When you choose the <span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide' strategy</span>, marketing for you is the process of:

- understanding customer needs and desires and 
- then creating products or services that satisfy those needs, 
- promoting, 
- and delivering those products or services, 
- in a way that benefits both the customer and the business (win-win). 

This involves a combination of strategic planning, market 'research', product and service development, pricing, promotion, distribution, and customer relationship development.

Here's a brief description of each element:

## **Understanding Customer Needs & Desires**

Effective marketing begins with gaining a deep understanding of what customers want, their preferences, and their pain points.

It takes a strong ethical commitment to customers to actively listen to them, even when their feedback might be challenging or critical. It also takes commitment to customer welfare to change and adapt your strategies based on their evolving needs and desires.


## **Design Product and Service**

Once customer needs are identified, you must develop products or services that address those needs and provide value.

Innovation in product and process may be required, which often requires a certain kind of courage. Developing new products or services that stand out in the market, challenge the status quo, and meet emerging needs requires the resolve to take risks and invest resources to ensure customers are delighted (not just satisfied).

## **Create Capability to Deliver Value**

Ensuring that products or services are available and accessible to customers through appropriate channels (e.g., physical stores, online platforms) is a key aspect of marketing.

Operational skill is crucial to ensure that your business consistently delivers on its promises. This means having a system to address internal challenges, make tough decisions, and ensure quality and reliability.

Customers must be able to 'pull' value from your company when, where, and how they desire. Convenience and ease of use are often as important as any technical aspect of the product or service.

## **Satisfying Needs to Benefit All (win-win)**

Ultimately, a special effort is needed to maintain a customer-centric approach. It's about standing up for what's right, ensuring fairness between the parties, and making decisions that benefit both customers and the business. In the long run those attitudes pay off; even if they are difficult in the short term.


## **Sales**

Sales is a special category because it is the result of many strategies executed in combination. Your company is a system of interdependent parts, not independent profit centers. This fact shows up in high relief when planning for company growth, but often receives inadequate attention. This is usually due to lack of business background and/or the personality traits of the owner.

- **Promotion**

Marketing involves creating awareness and interest in these products or services. This includes advertising, public relations, content marketing, and other promotional activities.

Marketing and promotion requires bold and creative presentation of product and service. Owners must find a way to accomplish this, even when their personalities are not naturally bold and creative. There are ways for shy and retiring owners to take their message to the public in creative and dynamic ways. Being unique means potentially facing criticism or rejection, but also the potential for great success.


- **Pricing**

Determining the right price for a product or service is a crucial marketing decision. Pricing should reflect both the perceived value to the customer and the business's profitability goals.


- **Customer Relationships**

Building and maintaining strong relationships with customers is vital. This includes providing excellent customer service, addressing feedback, and retaining loyal customers.


## **Thinking Long-Term**

- **Continuing Market Research**

Continual market research helps companies stay attuned to changing customer preferences, market trends, and competitive dynamics.


- **Building Your Brand**

Marketing contributes to brand development by establishing a unique identity and value proposition for the business and its products or services.


## **Achieving Your Business Goals**

Ultimately, marketing aims to help your business achieve its objectives, which includes increasing sales, market share, profitability, and brand recognition.

Marketing is a dynamic and multifaceted discipline that adapts to changes in technology, consumer behavior, and market conditions. It plays a central role in connecting companies with their target audience and creating growth and success.
