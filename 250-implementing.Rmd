# Implementing the <span class="font-size=32px font-weight=500 darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span> Strategy


## Define your general mission

Seek simplicity, and clarity.  This is no place for corporate jargon or doublespeak.

A good place to begin is: **“To Create Happy Customers”**
  


Which Way fits Your Personality and Management Style?

### 'Make, then Sell'

This is the traditional way and Command and Control is the prevailing style of management for this method.

### 'Listen, then Provide'

This way of creating value does not do well under Command and Control management.  In fact, C and C is mostly about doing what you are told, not listening.


## Define your Unique Value Proposition (business purpose)

## MARKETPLACE STRATEGY


Both product-driven and customer-driven approaches can offer advantages for differentiation in the marketplace, but they differ in how they achieve it. Here's an overview of how each approach can contribute to differentiation and the factors to consider:

## Product-Driven Approach for Differentiation:

### Innovation

This approach can lead to unique and innovative products or services that stand out in the market. If a company can develop cutting-edge technology or a revolutionary solution, it can create a significant competitive advantage.

### Brand Identity

Product-driven companies often build strong brand identities around their innovative products. Customers may associate the brand with high-quality, premium offerings.

### Early Adoption

Some customers are attracted to new and groundbreaking products, making early adopters a target audience.


## Factors for Product-Driven Differentiation:

### Research and Development

Invest in robust R&D capabilities to drive innovation.

### Market Timing

Launching new products at the right time can be crucial for success.

### Marketing and Promotion

Effective marketing strategies are needed to educate customers about the unique features and benefits of the product.


## Customer-Driven Approach for Differentiation:

### Tailored Solutions

Understanding customer needs allows a company to develop tailored solutions that directly address pain points. This can lead to products or services that precisely fit what the market desires.

### Customer Loyalty

Providing solutions that align with customer needs can foster strong customer loyalty and repeat business.

### Word of Mouth

Satisfied customers are more likely to become advocates and recommend the company's offerings to others.


## Factors for Customer-Driven Differentiation:

### Market Research

Conduct thorough market research to uncover customer preferences and pain points.

### Customer Feedback

Actively gather and listen to customer feedback to adapt and improve offerings.

### Agility

Be prepared to pivot quickly to meet changing customer demands.


## Factors to Consider for Choosing the Right Approach:

### Market Dynamics

Consider the maturity of the market and the competitive landscape. In rapidly changing markets, a product-driven approach may be necessary for disruption, while established markets may benefit more from a customer-driven approach.

### Resources

Evaluate your company's resources, capabilities, and expertise. A product-driven approach may require significant R&D investments.

### Customer-Centricity

Assess how well you can align with customer needs and whether your target market values tailored solutions.

### Risk Tolerance

Consider the level of risk your company is willing to take. Customer-driven strategies are generally considered less risky because they are based on validated market needs.

## Hybrid Strategies

Many successful companies use a combination of both approaches to differentiate and innovate while still meeting customer needs.

Ultimately, differentiation in the marketplace requires a deep understanding of the target audience, whether it's achieved through innovative products or tailored solutions. The key is to continually adapt to changing market dynamics and customer preferences to maintain a competitive edge.


## The amount of available funding and the business experience of the owner can significantly affect the choice of strategy for a startup or an existing business. Here's how:

## Funding Availability

- High Funding

If a business has substantial funding or access to significant capital, it may have the resources to pursue a product-driven approach. This means investing in research and development to create innovative products or services that can disrupt the market. High funding allows for the development of cutting-edge technologies and the ability to take risks in pursuit of differentiation.

- Limited Funding

Startups or businesses with limited funding may opt for a customer-driven approach. With constrained resources, it's often more practical to identify existing market needs and develop solutions that directly address those needs. This approach minimizes the risk of investing heavily in unproven product concepts.

## Business Experience

- Experienced Entrepreneurs

Entrepreneurs with extensive business experience may have a deeper understanding of market dynamics, customer behavior, and industry trends. They are more likely to use their experience to inform their strategy. Experienced entrepreneurs may be better equipped to assess the feasibility of product-driven approaches and manage the associated risks.

- Novice Entrepreneurs

Novice entrepreneurs, especially those entering a new industry or market, may prioritize a customer-driven approach. Their lack of industry experience may lead them to rely on market research and customer feedback to guide their decisions. This approach can help mitigate the risks associated with inexperience.

It's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the choice between a product-driven or customer-driven strategy depends on various factors, including market conditions, competitive landscape, available resources, and the entrepreneur's goals.

In some cases, a hybrid strategy that combines elements of both approaches may be the most effective way to balance innovation with market demand. Additionally, businesses should be adaptable and willing to reassess their strategy as circumstances change, including shifts in funding availability or the accumulation of business experience.



- Entering New Markets: Expanding into new markets, whether they are geographic regions or online platforms, often requires courage. It's a leap into the unknown, and there are risks involved. It takes courage to venture into unfamiliar territory and face potential challenges.

- Competing with Established Players: If you're entering a marketplace with dominant competitors, it takes confidence to challenge them. You'll need to believe in your unique value proposition and the courage to stand up to established players.

- Innovation: Marketplace success comes from being unique in a dimension that is important to customers. Whether it's offering a unique product, service, pricing model or experience. A certain resolve is required to go against the grain and introduce something new. You must be steadfast when you encounter the inevitable resistance when you don't follow traditional industry norms. Courage will help you persevere.

- Dealing with Uncertainty: Marketplaces are dynamic, and conditions can change rapidly. Having the courage to adapt and pivot your strategy when necessary is crucial. This means making tough decisions and sometimes letting go of strategies or products that aren't working.

- Ethical Considerations: Courage is vital when it comes to ethical decision-making in the marketplace. Standing up for your values, ensuring fair and ethical practices may require courage, especially when they go against the status quo.

- Resilience: Building and growing a presence in a marketplace can be challenging and full of setbacks. Courage is what keeps you resilient in the face of failures or setbacks, encouraging you to persevere and learn from your experiences.

- Customer Advocacy: Courage is also about standing up for your customers. It involves being willing to listen to their feedback, address their concerns, and make decisions that benefit them, even when it's difficult or requires changes to your strategy.

In essence, choosing a marketplace strategy requires courage because it involves taking risks, navigating uncertainty, and sometimes challenging the status quo.
