These two marketplace strategies are fundamentally different approaches to conducting business, often referred to as "product-driven" and "customer-driven" strategies.

For this book, I call the first strategy <span class="f3 darkgreen"> 'Make, then Sell'</span>

The second I call <span class="f3 darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span>

While <span class="darkgreen"> 'Make, then Sell'</span> is the predominant strategy employed since mass-production became possible, the lower-cost <span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide' strategy</span> is appropriate and available to any company. Companies with access to outside investors, or seeking outside investors, commonly are expected to use the <span class="darkgreen"> 'Make, then Sell' strategy</span>.

Every company in the marketplace employs one of these strategies in one form or another.  Unfortunately, many companies (particularly service companies) employ the <span class="darkgreen"> 'Make, then Sell'.</span> strategy but perform poorly with the 'Sell' element of the equation. They open up shop and hope that word of mouth will spontaneously occur through just the force of their technical skills. 

This book is meant especially for them.

## Product-Driven Strategy (<span class="darkgreen">'Make, then Sell'</span>)

- Focus

Using this strategy, the primary focus is on creating a product or service based on the company's vision, capabilities, and innovations - not necessarily on customer's expressed needs or desires. The American auto industry is an excellent example of this strategy. Features deemed important by top executives find expression in year's models. Silicon Valley hi-tech companies engage in intense competition over feature-rich hardware and software looking for uses in the marketplace.  Heavy investment in research and development is the primary mechanism to come up with unique offerings.

- Push Marketing

This approach relies on pushing the product or service into the market and trying to convince potential customers that they need it, or should want it. Watch television or go online and you will be inundated with companies using this approach.  Marketing and advertising play a crucial role in showcasing the product's features and hoped-for benefits. 

- Risk of Mismatch

If the product does not align with what customers actually want or need, it will lead to market rejection and financial losses. This strategy assumes that customers will adapt to the product rather than the product adapting to the customer.

## Customer-Driven Strategy (<span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span>)

- Needs Assessment

A <span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span> strategy begins with understanding customer needs, desires, and pain points. Market research, customer feedback, and data analysis are used to identify gaps and opportunities.

- Pull Marketing

With this approach, the emphasis is on creating products or services that directly address customer demands. It relies on "pull marketing," where customers are attracted to the product because it aligns with their existing needs.

- Reduced Risk

This strategy is generally considered less risky because it starts with a validated market need. It is more likely to lead to product-market fit and customer satisfaction.

## Considerations

- Market Dynamics

The choice between these strategies will depend on the nature of the market. In rapidly changing industries with emerging technologies, a product-driven approach may be necessary to innovate and create new markets. In more mature markets, a <span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span> approach is likely to be more effective.

- Customer-Centric

<span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span> strategies place strong emphasis on customer-centric behavior from all in the company.  This translates to stronger customer loyalty and long-term success.

- Hybrid Approaches

Some companies combine elements of both strategies. For example, they may use a <span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span> approach to identify current needs and also apply a product-driven approach to anticipate and create innovative solutions that solve customer problems of the future.

Ultimately, the success of either strategy depends on the ability to provide value to customers. In practice, companies often need to strike a balance between these two approaches, especially in competitive and evolving markets. Continuous feedback loops with customers and a willingness to adapt are crucial for long-term success.


## The Small Business

Small business owners, unlike startups seeking external investors, often face different considerations when choosing between product-driven and <span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span> strategies. Here are key factors small business owners should consider:

- Existing Customer Base

Small companies may already have an established customer base. Understanding the preferences, needs, and feedback of these existing customers is crucial. A <span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span> approach will help create and retain loyal customers and expand offerings based on their input.

- Resource Constraints

Small companies typically have limited resources, including financial resources and manpower. They must consider the resources available for product development, marketing, and operations. A <span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span> approach will be more cost-effective initially, and in the long run.

- Customer Relationships

Strong customer relationships are particularly important for small companies. Maintaining and nurturing these relationships provide valuable insights and word-of-mouth referrals.

- Alignment with Values

Ensure that your chosen strategy aligns with your business values and mission. Customers often appreciate companies that genuinely care about their needs and preferences.

- Financial Stability

Assess the financial stability of your business. If your business is financially stable, you may have more flexibility to invest in product development. However, if resources are limited, a <span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span> approach may be more practical.

Small business owners should carefully weigh these factors, taking into account their unique circumstances and goals. Flexibility and adaptability are also key as the business landscape evolves. It's often beneficial to start with a <span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span> approach to establish a strong customer base and then consider product-driven innovations as the business grows.


## Choosing Your Preferred Strategy


## Authenticity Matters

You cannot succeed in business if you try to be someone you're not.  Each of the two strategies will require different attitudes and behaviors from you.  If a strategy demands actions and decisions that are in conflict with your basic personality or values you will not succeed in implementing that strategy. That is setting yourself up for failure!

- Authenticity

Be true to yourself. Understand your values, beliefs, and strengths. Authenticity builds trust with customers, employees, and partners. People are drawn to authenticity because it's relatable and trustworthy.

- Know Your Niche

Identify a niche or market segment that aligns with your authentic self. Focus on areas where you have genuine interest and expertise. Will your chosen strategy work well in your niche or market segment? This makes it easier to stay passionate about what you're doing.

- Build Relationships

The <span class="darkgreen">'Listen, then Provide'</span> strategy relies on very strong customer relationships. Can you be sincere and build strong connections with clients, colleagues, and mentors? Authentic relationships will lead to collaboration and opportunities.

- Set Clear Boundaries

When choosing a strategy understand your limits and boundaries. Don't take on a strategy that doesn't align with your values or goals. Learning to say no when necessary is a sign of authenticity.

- Appreciate Your Uniqueness

Pick a strategy that can leverage your uniqueness as a competitive advantage. What sets you apart can be a selling point for your business. Embrace your quirks and idiosyncrasies!

## Final Thoughts

Before moving on to 'Implementation', keep these thoughts in mind...

- Continuous Learning

Stay curious and committed to learning and personal growth. Embrace change and adapt to new situations while staying true to your core values.  It is a hallmark of authenticity.

- Honesty and Transparency

Be open and honest in your business dealings. Transparency builds trust with customers and partners. Acknowledge mistakes and take responsibility when things go wrong.

- Define Success on Your Terms

Success means different things to different people. Define what success means to you personally, beyond financial metrics. This might include work-life balance, personal growth, or making a positive impact on your community.

- Seek Guidance

Consider working with a mentor or coach who can help you navigate the challenges of business while staying true to yourself. They can provide valuable insights and support.

- Stay Mindful

Regularly reflect on your values, goals, and the direction of your business. Mindfulness practices will help you stay connected to your authentic self.

- Appreciate the Small Wins

Acknowledge and be grateful for your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. Acknowledging progress boosts confidence and motivation.

- Surround Yourself with Support

Build a support network of friends, family, and peers who understand and appreciate your authentic self. They will provide encouragement during tough times.

Staying true to yourself in business will lead to a more fulfilling and successful entrepreneurial journey.
