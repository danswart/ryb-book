My Mission is to
 Create Happy
  Customers
  How About You?
                   11

THE CHALLENGE WE
FACE...

                   12

 How to become Unique in
     the marketplace
Because the more Unique you are, the
  more successfull you can become


                                       13

In the Marketplace
Contrast is Power

                     14

The best way to contrast with your
competitors
   is to be very Effective AND very
                Capable

    from your customer's point of view

                                         15

Unique
means
Standing out from
the crowd


                    16

Unique
means
being
unconventional


                 17

Avoid conventional logic because all
your competitors will use that

   Test counter-intuitive ideas because
                your competitors won't


                                          18

What is the Best Way to
 'Stand Out' and Be
       Unique?
                          19

Create the unstoppable chain
reaction:
     Become very Effective, then
Build awesome Capability to deliver
 And you will be irresistably Unique

                                       20

So, what does it mean
  to be "effective?"

                        21

Effective
means knowing what
creates REAL value for
customers - in their terms

and having the capability
to deliver it upon demand


                             22

   Effective means...
Strictly from the customer's point
             of view



                                     23

Your efforts must be Useful, or
          Fulfill a desire, or
                       Solve a problem
From the customer's point of view


                                         24

Effective
does NOT mean

Expedient
                25

Expedient =
          Quick, Interim or Temporary
Short-term, often at the expense of the
               long-term

Putting out fires, often at the expense
of the customer
                                          26

   Strangely, the opposite is NOT true:


   Efficient ≠ Effective
As you become more Effective you will
 automatically become more efficient
                                          27

 Productive ≠ Effective
As you become more Effective you will
automatically become more productive

                                        28

 But, don't just take my word for it...


Let's hear what Warren Buffet thinks
  about Effectiveness in delighting
             customers


                                          29

Buffet on the Importance of 'Customer Delight




                                                30

Some Cold, Hard Facts...



                           31

Half of new businesses fail in 5 years.
By year 10 fully two-thirds are gone.
    Only 10% make it to 20 years.




                                          32

    Studies and surveys also show
shocking failure rates for improvement
    initiatives that can range from

    50% to 70% or even higher.


                                         33

If you are ambitious and flexible,
  this is all good news for you!
* If you become Effective enough,
* If you become Capable enough,


* You will become Unique enough.
                                     34

It’s not remarkable that companies fail.

 It’s remarkable that
they fail so often, and
   have for so long!
                                           35

Obviously, we make the same mistakes
         over and over again


Otherwise, those grim survival statistics
    would have improved long ago,
                RIGHT?
                                            36

And what about
the companies
that are just
surviving?
They are neither
fully alive nor
completely dead
                   37

This is not a laziness problem, or an
        intelligence problem.
Most business owners are very hard-
working, and good at what they do.
               Right?

                                        38

But they’re not very good at turning all
            that hard work
    into prosperity and a better life
               are they?

                                           39

Where Companies Go
      Wrong

                     40

What?!



         41

They are ‘Same-As’:
EACH COMPANY
JUST LIKE THE
REST
 Afraid to be different

                          42

'Same-As' companies don't last long in
           the marketplace




                                         43

They Copy, Copy, Copy
Everyone from business
schools to self-help books
continue to tell owners that
copying others is the
solution to their problems.



                               44

'Follow-the-Herd' companies don't
stand a chance in the marketplace




                                    45

Woo Hoo! Let's do
what everyone else
      does!

                     46

On top of that, most 'Solutions' are
 Incompatible with their existing
             systems




                                       47

  For example, companies naturally
adopt the style of management known
      as ‘command-and-control’




                                      48

Unfortunately
most improvement
schemes (and many
company goals) are
incompatible with this style
of management



                               49

So, most improvement efforts are
    doomed from the outset




                                   50

So, what's a leader to do?
* Learn to be more Effective,

                                in the eyes of your customers

* Learn to be more Capable

                                in the eyes of your customers

* Learn to be more Unique

                                in the eyes of your customers 51

These things hardly cost a thing...
* But, they require a different mindset
* A sense of urgency, and
* The willingness to try new things


                                          52

  The reward is to
become Unique in the
    marketplace
                       53

Which is the Point!

                      54

WHAT TO DO NOW?

                  55

FIRST...
Adopt a plain-spoken aim such as "Our
Mission is to Create Happy Customers!"
Lose the corporate-speak, gobbelty-gook
jargon. It makes it much harder for
everyone to do a great job.
                                          56

Next...    Learn
first-hand what your
customers value --

 from their point of view




                            57

Next...   Learn
first-hand, what your
customers experience
when dealing with your
company

(the good, bad, and ugly)

                            58

Remember, management Is Not Very
Good at Guessing What Customers Value


  So, it PAYS (a lot) to
   Ask Them Directly
                                        59

         Case Study
Initially, Dr. T and her team came up
with 23 ideas of creating more value
            for her customers


                                        60

Let's see how they did
   by themselves...

                         61

62

63

64

65

If there is any way at
           all
   Ask Customers
      Directly!
                         66

 It PAYS (a lot) to
Ask Them Directly
                      67

Then...
create Capability so
customers can pull the
value they need from you

(when, where, and how
they want to)


                           68

        Case Study
Stew Leonard's Dairy has mastered
the ability to 'Listen, then Deliver'

Stew Jr on the Power of Customer Suggestions




                                               70

Some Things To AVOID...

                          71

BEWARE OF...
Slogans, and so-called ‘best practices’,
Agile, Lean, or Six-Sigma,
Mission & Vision statements full of buzzwords,
Servant leadership

              These are management fads
                                                 72

  They all avoid the responsibiltiy to

create and maintain a system based on

     Effectiveness and Capability

                                         73

GUIDING PRINCIPLE:
 Focus on measures of Effectiveness

                 ~

   Not on measures of Efficiency
                                      76

GUIDING PRINCIPLE:
 Focus on measures of Effectiveness

                 ~

    Not measures of Productivity
                                      77

GUIDING PRINCIPLE:

   When you focus on measures of Effectiveness &
                    Capability

                          ~
You will automatically be more Efficient and Productive
                                                          78

To be Unique You
Must Be Effective!
     (EVERY DAY)


                     79

To be Unique You
Must Be Capable!
     (EVERY DAY)


                   80

If you're looking for a 'sure-fire', low-cost
   way to prosper in the marketplace...
           Become very Unique
       by becoming very Effective
            and very Capable

                                                81
