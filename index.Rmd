This is the website for my first book, __[*Reimagine Your Business:  A Personalized Guide to Becoming a Winner at Business* (Swart 2023)]()__.  

It is a book with remarkable qualities, above and beyond its' written content.  Due to recent advances in web-based technology this book is not just a good read but is a guide to your personalized <span style="color: darkgreen; font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">experience</span>.

Beyond the 'learning' there is the 'doing.'  Readers can commit their thoughts to writing by composing their reimagined business ideas on-screen.  No data is retained anywhere so readers can save them to a pdf file.  Or, they can use the old fashioned way of actual handwriting.  

Interactive graphics invite readers to drop in their own company numbers and see how the ideas might (hypothetically) affect their company.  It's a great way to 'test' an idea on your business before you commit to a change.  Again, no data is retained anywhere so you can keep the results of those 'tests' by creating a pdf file for future use in reimagining your company.

When (not if) readers change their minds, or circumstances change, they can revisit a section of the book and complete the exercise again and preserve their revised work.  There is no limit to the number of iterations you can perform.  It is a great example of Deming's 'Plan-Do-Study-Act' improvement cycle.

I'm seasoned enough that, to me, it's like magic.  I've not heard of a 'self-help' book quite like it.  If you have, please let me know.

## Other Books {-}

These books will also help you:

* __"[The New Economics (3rd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0262535947/thewedwdemins-20)"__ this is an advanced management book by W. Edwards Deming (https://deming.org/), who demonstrates that only by viewing your organization as a system, and considering how decisions impact the entire system over the long term, can you gain the most powerful marketplace advantages possible (see for example, Toyota Motor Company https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota).

* __"[Beyond Command and Control (2019)](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Command-Control-John-Seddon/dp/152723956X)"__ wherein John Seddon explains the pitfalls of the Command & Control management style, what it is, and how this style of management might be good for the military but is wholly incompatible with most of the quality practices of the most successful organizations. (He spells words in that funny British way, but don't let that stop you!) https://whatisthevanguardmethod.net/

* __"[Entrepreneur to Millionaire: How to Build a Highly Profitable, Fast-Growth Company and Become Embarrassingly Rich Doing It (2021) ](https://www.amazon.com/Entrepreneur-Millionaire-Profitable-Fast-Growth-Embarrassingly/dp/1264257120)"__ Mr. Billingsley teaches you the power of knowing ***exactly*** why your company exists, and how to make the most of that knowledge in the marketplace of today.
