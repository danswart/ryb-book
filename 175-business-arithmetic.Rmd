The arithmetic of business is just that; arithmetic.  Not even algebra.  Certainly not calculus.  Just simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  ANYONE can do it, so don't shy away from it.  As they love to say these days: "Embrace It!"  "Celebrate It!"

There are situations in business when higher mathematics can help solve complex problems such as distribution chains, fulfillment networks, and product mix challenges.  But, those are problems that arise AFTER you get the fundamental arithmetic right.  Remember that these types of problems were being 'solved' long before computer algorithms and data mining were supposed to save our companies.

There is a wonderful and powerful insight that comes when you look at your business arithmetic...<br>

A SYSTEM of components is NOT about addition...it's about MULTIPLICATION.

And, ALL companies are systems.

In a system the components are always interdependent, each component affects all others.  The effects in a system are multiplicative, not additive.  You can't simply add the performance of the sales team, to the marketing team, to the purchasing team, to the HR team, to the production team, to the advertising team, etc.

Even in the smallest company the work is a chain reaction - each step depending on the work of the previous step.

::: {.rmdtip}
Here's an example from a tiny 5-employee design firm of how multiplication affects the outcome:  

Each member of the team, from the receptionist to the managing partner, answered this simple question:  "Estimate how often (as a percentage) you get everything you need to do your part of the work right the first time?"

They replied:  90%, 75%, 85%, 95% and 45%

The probability that the work will get done right the first time is...&nbsp;&nbsp; less than 25% of the time!

(90% x 75% x 85% x 95% x 45% = 24.5%)

That is a huge amount of starting, restarting and backtracking to get the jobs through.  It creates a lot of expensive waste.  When they realized this they addressed it.  When they addressed it they improved both financially and culturally.

Consider that in a 5-step system (multiplicative), even when employees get all they need 99% of the time, the probability of getting it done right the first time drops to 95%.  In a chain of 20 steps a 99% rate drops to 82%!  

Each individual step has a very high performance rate, yet the performance of the whole is degrading as steps are added.
:::
<br>

This graph illustrates how adding steps to a process (multiplication) can degrade performance:
<br>

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Generate x values (number of links in the chain)
x <- 5:100

# Calculate the probability of success for each x
probability <- 100 * (0.99 ^ x)

# Create the plot
plot(x, probability, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2, xlab = "Number of Links in the Chain",
     ylab = "Probability of Success of the Whole Process (%)", main = "Compare the Probability of Getting The Job Done\n Right the First Time as the Number of \n Links in the Chain Increases")

# Add a grid
grid()

# Adjust the y-axis limits
ylim <- c(0, 100)
axis(2, at = seq(0, 100, by = 10), labels = seq(0, 100, by = 10))

# Add a text comment in the top-right portion
percentage_text <- "Links in the chain get all they need\n the first time 99% of the time"
x_coord <- max(x) - 25
y_coord <- max(probability) - 10
text(x_coord, y_coord, percentage_text, font = 2, cex = 0.9)


```

<br><br>
Those are startling facts, but true and hold real power for those who understand their implications.

When you have a company where the final step depends on the step before, and the step before depends on the step before that, etc. you MUST learn the power of multiplication over addition.  Note to self:  EVERY BUSINESS IS A SYSTEM.

This is why troubles can multiply; but so can successes.


Traditionally, companies are seen as just a conglomeration, consisting of many separate parts or elements.  Each division, department, or individual adds their bit to the total (a + b + c + d = e) and the company profit is maximized as each part makes more and more profit.

This 'conglomeration' perspective has a certain instinctive appeal.  'Divide and Conquer' is the obvious solution.  If you adopt it, the natural thing to do is divide the work into functions, assign a taskmaster to each function, 'drive' the work of each function, and count up the profits (a + b + c + d = e).

This perspective, appealing as it is, contains a serious flaw.  It ignores the interdependence of the parts.  Divisions, departments, and individuals will strive to maximize their performance even when it degrades the performance of the system as a whole.

Treating parts of a system as independent of each other (competition between divisions, departments, individuals) severely limits the results.  In this scenario the power of multiplication multiplies the problems, but not the benefits.  

Treating the parts as interdependent multiplies the benefits, and minimizes the problems.

It's not that you get no results at all when you treat the parts as independent.  A lot of money has been made by 'incentivizing' the parts of the organization to compete with each other.  But, that only works well when the company has no competitors treating the parts of their companies as interdependent.

All other things being equal, companies using collaboration of the parts instead of competition between the parts are winning in the marketplace.  Just ask Ford and GM how Toyota is doing.  Currently, 1 share of Toyota stock is worth more than 1 share each of Ford and GM combined.  The examples in this book are there to illustrate just this point.

If you could choose, which scenario would you prefer?

Well, you do have the power to choose the scenario you prefer.  YOU are the boss afterall!

The idea to remember that multiplication is more powerful than addition.  So, look for opportunities to leverage multiplication in your business.

Here's a plot illustrating what the effects are when elements are added together versus when elements are multiplied together:


```{r add vs multiply, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}


# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2) 

# Create a data frame with x values
x <- 1:10

# Calculate the corresponding y values for different functions
df <- data.frame(
  x = rep(x, 4),
  y = c(2 + x, 2^x, 2 * x^2, 2 * x^3),
  Function = rep(c("Addition (2 + x)", "Multiplication (2^x)", "Quadratic (2 * x^2)", "Cubic (2 * x^3)"), each = 10)
)

# Define the order of legend entries
legend_order <- c("Cubic (2 * x^3)", "Multiplication (2^x)", "Quadratic (2 * x^2)", "Addition (2 + x)")

# Create the plot
ggplot2::ggplot(df, ggplot2::aes(x)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = y, color = Function), linewidth = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "In Just 10 Cycles\n Multiplication Far Exceeds Addition",
    x = "Cycles",
    y = "Amount"
  ) +
  ggplot2::scale_color_manual(
    values = c("Cubic (2 * x^3)" = "purple",
               "Multiplication (2^x)" = "blue",
               "Quadratic (2 * x^2)" = "green",
               "Addition (2 + x)" = "red"),
    breaks = legend_order
  ) +
  ggplot2::theme(
    plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),  # Centered title
    axis.title = ggplot2::element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),  # Bigger and bold axis titles
    axis.text = ggplot2::element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),  # Bigger axis text
#     legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank(),  # Remove legend title
    legend.text = ggplot2::element_text(size = 16, face = "bold")  # Bigger and bold legend text

Profitability as an Equation

\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\text{Profit}} = Revenue \times Profitability
  (\#eq:profit1)
\end{equation}
<br><br>


Your SYSTEM of Generating Revenue can be represented by this equation

\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\text{Revenue}} = \text{Number of Delighted Customers Buying from You} \times \\ \text{Transaction Frequency} \times \\ \text{Average Transaction Value (ATV)}
  (\#eq:revenue1)
\end{equation}
<br><br>

You should commit this equation to memory.  It is very important.

Note that the 



The "Number of Customers Buying from You" represents an estimate of the volume of customers buying your product or services.  It is the result of these components working together:

\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\text{Customers Retained} + \\ \text{Customers Acquired}}
  (\#eq:revshrt1)
\end{equation}
<br><br>


"Customers Retained" represents an estimate of the NUMBER of customers from the Beginning of the Year expected to be with you at the End of the Year.  It is the result of these components working together:

\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\text{Existing Customers, BOY} \times \\ \text{Retention Rate}}
  (\#eq:revshrt2)
\end{equation}
<br><br>


The "Retention Rate" represents an estimate of the PROPORTION of customers from Beginning of the Year expected to be there at the End of the Year.  It is the result of these components working together:

\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    \text{1} - \text{Attrition Rate}}
  (\#eq:revshrt3)
\end{equation}
<br><br>


The "Attrition Rate" represents an estimate of the PROPORTION of customers at the Beginning of the Year you expect will leave during the year.  It is the result of these components working together:

\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    \left( 
          \frac{
                \text{
                        Number of Customers at BOY Expected to Leave During the Year
                     }
               }
                {
                  \text{
                        Existing Customers, Beg of Year
                        }
                }
    \right)
        }
  (\#eq:revshrt4)
\end{equation}
<br><br>


"Customers Acquired" represents an estimate of the NUMBER of new or returning customers who were not with you at the Beginning of the Year.  It is the result of these components working together:

\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\text{Prospects Generated} \times \\ \text{Conversion Rate}}
  (\#eq:revshrt5)
\end{equation}
<br><br>


The "Conversion Rate" represents an estimate of the PROPORTION of prospects generated that become paying customers.  It is the result of these components working together:

\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    \frac
      {\text
        {Prospects Converted to Customers}
      }
      {\text
       {Prospoects Generated}
      }
     }
  (\#eq:revshrt6)
\end{equation}
<br><br>


From these we see that some of the components of revenue are basic elements, and some are compound elements made up of two or more basic elements.  We improve the total revenue stream by coordinating and balancing all the elements.

It is wrong to think that maximizing each and every element will compound into an improvement in the total.  Mathematically, it looks correct.  But, that sort of arithmetic assumes that all the components are independent from each other.  In fact, they are part of a system of components that are interdependent.  Each has an effect on all the others.

Is a system, the parts of the system must compliment each other.  Sometimes one part must not be maximized due to its negative effect on other parts.  This is called 'optimization' of the parts of the system, and stands in stark contrast to 'maximizing' each part of the system.

'Maximizing the parts' is the kind of thinking that encourages management to treat different divisions, departments, groups, and even individuals as 'profit centers' that are to compete with each other in order to maximize total profit.  The results of such a setup are
