# Case Study - Stew Leonard's Dairy Store

This chapter uses long-form video content allowing readers to sit back, listen and watch examples of the key business lessons directly from the entrepreneurs themselves.  The duration is listed with the video.  A timeline of highlights is provided in the text below.  Now, sit back, enjoy, and be inspired!

Every example in this book comes with this caution:<br>

<span style="color: red;">'Don't copy 'Best Practices'</span>... &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">'INSTEAD, TEST THEORIES AND PRINCIPLES'</span>.

The practices and procedures you see in the examples are the creative expression of an underlying principle or theory that is being tested for success in a specific setting.  

They represent part of a chain reaction (theory) the company hopes will bring the results they desire.  You must understand the chain reaction behind the practice to understand how the idea might help your company.

Remember:  Every company is one-of-a-kind.  Different owners, people, products or services, machines, methods, measures, marketplaces, and locations.  Your setting will always be different, even though you might be in the same industry.

One of the best lessons of an example is:  <span style="color: blue;">'TRY NOVEL IDEAS BECAUSE YOUR COMPETITORS WON'T'</span>

Here's a chain reaction (theory) that describes WHY Stew Leonard's operates the way it does:

**HAPPY PEOPLE <span style="font-size: 24px;">&#x2192;</span> HAPPY CUSTOMERS <span style="font-size: 24px;">&#x2192;</span> HAPPY BANKER <span style="font-size: 24px;">&#x2192;</span> HAPPY OWNER**

</div>

(Where you see <span style="font-size: 20px;">&#x2192;</span>, read "...leads to...)



## Background

Stew Leonard's Dairy Store was 'discovered' when it was included in Tom Peters' now-classic book ***In Search of Excellence***.  Stew Leonard's is an extraordinary business and a real-life example of most key principles found in this book.  Namely,


- Simple ideas, taken very, very seriously
- Uses the 'Learn, then Provide' strategy to create additional value for everyone
- The creative courage to be different
- Purposeful positioning relative to competitors
- Real empowerment; not the fake variety so popular today
- Treating the business as a system of interdependent parts, not as independent profit centers.  All departments work together to accomplish the common mission.
- Don't copy 'Best Practices', COPY 'BEST THEORIES AND PRINCIPLES'.
