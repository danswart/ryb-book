# Stew Leonard's Dairy Store

Every example in this book comes with this caution:<br>
<span style="color: red;"><u>Don't copy 'Best Practices'</u></span>, <span style="color: blue;">COPY 'BEST THEORIES AND PRINCIPLES'</span>.

The practices and procedures you see are the creative expressions of an underlying company principle, or theory, that is being tested for success.  They represent part of a chain reaction the company hopes will bring the results they desire.  You must understand the chain reaction behind the practice to understand how the idea might help your company.

Here's a chain reaction (theory) that describes WHY Stew Leonard's operates the way it does:

<div align="center">

**HAPPY EMPLOYEES <span style="font-size: 24px;">&#x2192;</span> HAPPY CUSTOMERS <span style="font-size: 24px;">&#x2192;</span> HAPPY BANKER <span style="font-size: 24px;">&#x2192;</span> HAPPY OWNER**

</div>

Don't replicate the practice or process of others.  Use the theory or principle to create <span style="font-size: 20px;">&#x2192;</span>



## Background

Stew Leonard's Dairy Store was 'discovered' when it was included in Tom Peters' now-classic book ***In Search of Excellence***.  Stew Leonard's is an extraordinary business and a real-life example of most key principles found in this book.  Namely,


- Simple ideas, taken very, very seriously
- Uses the 'Learn, then Provide' strategy to create additional value for everyone
- The creative courage to be different
- Purposeful positioning relative to competitors
- Real empowerment; not the fake variety so popular today
- Treating the business as a system of interdependent parts, not as independent profit centers.  All departments work together to accomplish the common mission.
- Don't copy 'Best Practices', COPY 'BEST THEORIES AND PRINCIPLES'.
