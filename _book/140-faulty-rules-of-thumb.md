<span style="color: maroon;">MARKETPLACE ASPIRATION:    **"We want to... be the market of choice for dairy products and produce in the tri-state area...to do that we must...create delighted customers."**</span> 

Becomes...<span style="color: maroon;">**"Our Mission is to Create Delighted Customers"**</span>

Everyone in that enterprise knows a happy customer when they see one, and an unhappy customer when they see one.  That mission statement informs people from the top of the organization chart to the bottom whether the company did a great job, or whether the value delivery system could improve.


<span style="color: maroon;">PHILOSOPHY:</span>  **Rule #1 - The Customer is Always Right.  If the Customer is Ever Wrong, See Rule #1"**

<span style="color: maroon;">MARKETPLACE STRATEGY:</span>  **Offer freshest produce and dairy products at the lowest cost with an in-store experience that leaves customers saying "WOW!"  The in-store experience will be very difficult for competitors to duplicate.**

<span style="color: maroon;">MARKETPLACE TACTICS:</span>  **Produce our own in-store, super-high-quality, super-low-cost dairy products.  Buy produce directly from farmers from coast-to-coast to guarantee quality and freshness (and cut out the middleman).  Insist on highest quality on all other store products.  Sell fewer products but buy in higher quantities and pass the savings on.  This alone will make us meaningfully different than the competition.**

<span style="color: maroon;">BECOMES:</span>  **"Our mission is to create delighted customers."**
