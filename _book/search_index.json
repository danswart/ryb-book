For this book, I call the first strategy ‘Make, then Sell’ The second I call ‘Listen, then Provide’ While ‘Make, then Sell’ is the predominant strategy employed since mass-production became possible, the lower-cost ‘Listen, then Provide’ strategy is appropriate and available to any company. Companies with access to outside investors, or seeking outside investors, commonly are expected to use the ‘Make, then Sell’ strategy. Every company in the marketplace employs one of these strategies in one form or another. Unfortunately, many companies (particularly service companies) employ the ‘Make, then Sell’. strategy but perform poorly with the ‘Sell’ element of the equation. They open up shop and hope that word of mouth will spontaneously occur through just the force of their technical skills. This book is meant especially for them. 1.1 Product-Driven Strategy (‘Make, then Sell’) Focus Using this strategy, the primary focus is on creating a product or service based on the company’s vision, capabilities, and innovations - not necessarily on customer’s expressed needs or desires. The American auto industry is an excellent example of this strategy. Features deemed important by top executives find expression in year’s models. Silicon Valley hi-tech companies engage in intense competition over feature-rich hardware and software looking for uses in the marketplace. Heavy investment in research and development is the primary mechanism to come up with unique offerings. Push Marketing This approach relies on pushing the product or service into the market and trying to convince potential customers that they need it, or should want it. Watch television or go online and you will be inundated with companies using this approach. Marketing and advertising play a crucial role in showcasing the product’s features and hoped-for benefits. Risk of Mismatch If the product does not align with what customers actually want or need, it will lead to market rejection and financial losses. This strategy assumes that customers will adapt to the product rather than the product adapting to the customer. 1.2 Customer-Driven Strategy (‘Listen, then Provide’) Needs Assessment A ‘Listen, then Provide’ strategy begins with understanding customer needs, desires, and pain points. Market research, customer feedback, and data analysis are used to identify gaps and opportunities. Pull Marketing With this approach, the emphasis is on creating products or services that directly address customer demands. It relies on “pull marketing,” where customers are attracted to the product because it aligns with their existing needs. Reduced Risk This strategy is generally considered less risky because it starts with a validated market need. It is more likely to lead to product-market fit and customer satisfaction. 1.3 Considerations Market Dynamics The choice between these strategies will depend on the nature of the market. In rapidly changing industries with emerging technologies, a product-driven approach may be necessary to innovate and create new markets. In more mature markets, a ‘Listen, then Provide’ approach is likely to be more effective. Customer-Centric ‘Listen, then Provide’ strategies place strong emphasis on customer-centric behavior from all in the company. This translates to stronger customer loyalty and long-term success. Hybrid Approaches Some companies combine elements of both strategies. For example, they may use a ‘Listen, then Provide’ approach to identify current needs and also apply a product-driven approach to anticipate and create innovative solutions that solve customer problems of the future. Ultimately, the success of either strategy depends on the ability to provide value to customers. In practice, companies often need to strike a balance between these two approaches, especially in competitive and evolving markets. Continuous feedback loops with customers and a willingness to adapt are crucial for long-term success. 1.4 The Small Business Small business owners, unlike startups seeking external investors, often face different considerations when choosing between product-driven and ‘Listen, then Provide’ strategies. Here are key factors small business owners should consider: Existing Customer Base Small companies may already have an established customer base. Understanding the preferences, needs, and feedback of these existing customers is crucial. A ‘Listen, then Provide’ approach will help create and retain loyal customers and expand offerings based on their input. Resource Constraints Small companies typically have limited resources, including financial resources and manpower. They must consider the resources available for product development, marketing, and operations. A ‘Listen, then Provide’ approach will be more cost-effective initially, and in the long run. Customer Relationships Strong customer relationships are particularly important for small companies. Maintaining and nurturing these relationships provide valuable insights and word-of-mouth referrals. Alignment with Values Ensure that your chosen strategy aligns with your business values and mission. Customers often appreciate companies that genuinely care about their needs and preferences. Financial Stability Assess the financial stability of your business. If your business is financially stable, you may have more flexibility to invest in product development. However, if resources are limited, a ‘Listen, then Provide’ approach may be more practical. Small business owners should carefully weigh these factors, taking into account their unique circumstances and goals. Flexibility and adaptability are also key as the business landscape evolves. It’s often beneficial to start with a ‘Listen, then Provide’ approach to establish a strong customer base and then consider product-driven innovations as the business grows. 1.5 Choosing Your Preferred Strategy 1.6 Authenticity Matters You cannot succeed in business if you try to be someone you’re not. Each of the two strategies will require different attitudes and behaviors from you. If a strategy demands actions and decisions that are in conflict with your basic personality or values you will not succeed in implementing that strategy. That is setting yourself up for failure! Authenticity Be true to yourself. Understand your values, beliefs, and strengths. Authenticity builds trust with customers, employees, and partners. People are drawn to authenticity because it’s relatable and trustworthy. Know Your Niche Identify a niche or market segment that aligns with your authentic self. Focus on areas where you have genuine interest and expertise. Will your chosen strategy work well in your niche or market segment? This makes it easier to stay passionate about what you’re doing. Build Relationships The ‘Listen, then Provide’ strategy relies on very strong customer relationships. Can you be sincere and build strong connections with clients, colleagues, and mentors? Authentic relationships will lead to collaboration and opportunities. Set Clear Boundaries When choosing a strategy understand your limits and boundaries. Don’t take on a strategy that doesn’t align with your values or goals. Learning to say no when necessary is a sign of authenticity. Appreciate Your Uniqueness Pick a strategy that can leverage your uniqueness as a competitive advantage. What sets you apart can be a selling point for your business. Embrace your quirks and idiosyncrasies! 1.7 Final Thoughts Before moving on to ‘Implementation’, keep these thoughts in mind… Continuous Learning Stay curious and committed to learning and personal growth. Embrace change and adapt to new situations while staying true to your core values. It is a hallmark of authenticity. Honesty and Transparency Be open and honest in your business dealings. Transparency builds trust with customers and partners. Acknowledge mistakes and take responsibility when things go wrong. Define Success on Your Terms Success means different things to different people. Define what success means to you personally, beyond financial metrics. This might include work-life balance, personal growth, or making a positive impact on your community. Seek Guidance Consider working with a mentor or coach who can help you navigate the challenges of business while staying true to yourself. They can provide valuable insights and support. Stay Mindful Regularly reflect on your values, goals, and the direction of your business. Mindfulness practices will help you stay connected to your authentic self. Appreciate the Small Wins Acknowledge and be grateful for your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. Acknowledging progress boosts confidence and motivation. Surround Yourself with Support Build a support network of friends, family, and peers who understand and appreciate your authentic self. They will provide encouragement during tough times. Staying true to yourself in business will lead to a more fulfilling and successful entrepreneurial journey. ========================== The remainder of the book assumes you have chosen the ‘Listen, then Provide’ - Customer-Driven strategy This is a sample book written in Markdown.

Does your local (regional, national, or global) market really need another… Doctor’s office Architect firm CPA firm Grocery store Funeral home Auto parts store Fast-food restaurant Beauty salon Printer Auto repair shop Bookkeeper Graphic design firm Marketing firm…. Why do you need to have a company? You could be an employee with the same skill set, degree or certification. Are you just looking for a way to avoid having a boss? Kent Billingsley (author of the excellent book Entrepreneur to Millionaire (available here) asks you to look at it like an entrepreneur does. First, look for an unmet need in the marketplace. Then, form a company to address it - even if you don’t personally have the skill, expertise or technical know-how that is needed. You can always hire or partner with someone with the requisite skill sets. Many people approach it the other way round. They acquire a skill, degree or certification and they hope the marketplace will reward them for working so hard in the past and taking the leap to open a company. These are often the companies that struggle the most. Mr. Billingsley devised a powerful set of 3 questions to clarify why your company even exists. What marketplace problem are you offering to solve? Why hasn’t this problem been solved yet?     and What is your UNIQUE solution? He points out that the FIRST question is strictly from the consumer’s point of view. Your proposed solution should not be anywhere in your answer to this question. The SECOND question is strictly a statement of WHY a satisfactory solution is still not available - strictly from the customer’s point of view. Again, your proposed solution should not appear anywhere in this answer. Finally, the THIRD question is about YOU and YOUR solution, but you must describe how your solution is UNIQUE. Many established companies struggle to answer these three questions. The company may be surviving, and might even be doing well right now, but only because their competitors are likewise unable to supply the answers. Let’s work through an example. This method provides a stringent test on how much research you have done before opening your business, and your tolerance for risk. No amount of ‘research’ will guarantee success since it is not a direct measurement of how consumers will react to the product or service. Companies with insufficient effort on this step may have to act on supposition, superstition, or faith. They find themselves using a Product-Driven Strategy (‘Make, then Sell’) whether they want it or not. On the other hand, in 1975 advertising executive Gary Dahl sold over 1 million ‘Pet Rocks’ for $4 each and became a millionaire! (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock) (more on the value strategy choice in Chapter ??) 2.2 Considerations When Answering the 3 Questions Competitive Landscape Assess the competition in your industry or niche. Are there gaps in the market that you can fill with innovative products, or is it saturated with similar offerings? Understanding the competitive landscape will also guide your choice of strategy later. Market Research Conduct thorough market research to identify market trends, perceived customer preferences, and unmet needs. Small business owners usually rely on cost-effective methods such as small surveys, interviews, and online research to help gather this information. Speed to Market Consider how quickly you need to bring your product or service to market. If there’s a time-sensitive opportunity, a product-driven approach may be necessary. Risk Tolerance Assess honestly your risk tolerance as a business owner. Product-driven approaches often involve higher risks because they require substantial investments in product development before the need is known. A ‘Listen, then Provide’ approach may offer a safer entry into the market. Business Expertise Evaluate your expertise and that of your team. Do you have industry-specific knowledge or technical skills that the competition will find difficult to duplicate? Or, will enable you to create innovative products? Long-Term Vision Consider your long-term vision for the business. Are you looking for sustainable growth and customer loyalty, or is your goal to create disruptive innovations that could lead to rapid expansion? Your vision will also guide your choice of strategy later. ACTION ITEMS Write down your answer to “What marketplace problem are you offering to solve?” Write down your answer to “Why hasn’t this problem been solved yet?” Write down your answer to “What is your UNIQUE solution?” When you have clear answers to these three questions… all of your other marketplace challenges are MUCH easier to meet.

This involves a combination of strategic planning, market ‘research’, product and service development, pricing, promotion, distribution, and customer relationship development. Here’s a brief description of each element: 3.1 Understanding Customer Needs &amp; Desires Effective marketing begins with gaining a deep understanding of what customers want, their preferences, and their pain points. It takes a strong ethical commitment to customers to actively listen to them, even when their feedback might be challenging or critical. It also takes commitment to customer welfare to change and adapt your strategies based on their evolving needs and desires. 3.2 Design Product and Service Once customer needs are identified, you must develop products or services that address those needs and provide value. Innovation in product and process may be required, which often requires a certain kind of courage. Developing new products or services that stand out in the market, challenge the status quo, and meet emerging needs requires the resolve to take risks and invest resources to ensure customers are delighted (not just satisfied). 3.3 Create Capability to Deliver Value Ensuring that products or services are available and accessible to customers through appropriate channels (e.g., physical stores, online platforms) is a key aspect of marketing. Operational skill is crucial to ensure that your business consistently delivers on its promises. This means having a system to address internal challenges, make tough decisions, and ensure quality and reliability. Customers must be able to ‘pull’ value from your company when, where, and how they desire. Convenience and ease of use are often as important as any technical aspect of the product or service. 3.4 Satisfying Needs to Benefit All (win-win) Ultimately, a special effort is needed to maintain a customer-centric approach. It’s about standing up for what’s right, ensuring fairness between the parties, and making decisions that benefit both customers and the business. In the long run those attitudes pay off; even if they are difficult in the short term. 3.5 Sales Sales is a special category because it is the result of many strategies executed in combination. Your company is a system of interdependent parts, not independent profit centers. This fact shows up in high relief when planning for company growth, but often receives inadequate attention. This is usually due to lack of business background and/or the personality traits of the owner. Promotion Marketing involves creating awareness and interest in these products or services. This includes advertising, public relations, content marketing, and other promotional activities. Marketing and promotion requires bold and creative presentation of product and service. Owners must find a way to accomplish this, even when their personalities are not naturally bold and creative. There are ways for shy and retiring owners to take their message to the public in creative and dynamic ways. Being unique means potentially facing criticism or rejection, but also the potential for great success. Pricing Determining the right price for a product or service is a crucial marketing decision. Pricing should reflect both the perceived value to the customer and the business’s profitability goals. Customer Relationships Building and maintaining strong relationships with customers is vital. This includes providing excellent customer service, addressing feedback, and retaining loyal customers. 3.6 Thinking Long-Term Continuing Market Research Continual market research helps companies stay attuned to changing customer preferences, market trends, and competitive dynamics. Building Your Brand Marketing contributes to brand development by establishing a unique identity and value proposition for the business and its products or services. 3.7 Achieving Your Business Goals Ultimately, marketing aims to help your business achieve its objectives, which includes increasing sales, market share, profitability, and brand recognition. Marketing is a dynamic and multifaceted discipline that adapts to changes in technology, consumer behavior, and market conditions. It plays a central role in connecting companies with their target audience and creating growth and success.

Here’s how it plays a role: Entering New Markets: Expanding into new markets, whether they are geographic regions or online platforms, often requires courage. It’s a leap into the unknown, and there are risks involved. It takes courage to venture into unfamiliar territory and face potential challenges. Competing with Established Players: If you’re entering a marketplace with dominant competitors, it takes courage to challenge them. You’ll need the confidence to believe in your unique value proposition and the courage to stand up to established players. Innovation: Marketplace success often comes from innovation. Whether it’s offering a unique product, service, or pricing model, courage is required to go against the grain and introduce something new. There may be resistance from traditional industry norms, but courage can help you break through. Dealing with Uncertainty: Marketplaces are dynamic, and conditions can change rapidly. Having the courage to adapt and pivot your strategy when necessary is crucial. This means making tough decisions and sometimes letting go of strategies or products that aren’t working. Ethical Considerations: Courage is also vital when it comes to ethical decision-making in the marketplace. Standing up for your values, ensuring fair and ethical practices, and addressing issues like sustainability or social responsibility may require courage, especially when they go against the status quo. Resilience: Building and growing a presence in a marketplace can be challenging and full of setbacks. Courage is what keeps you resilient in the face of failures or setbacks, encouraging you to persevere and learn from your experiences.

Here’s an overview of how each approach can contribute to differentiation and the factors to consider: 5.4 Product-Driven Approach for Differentiation: 5.4.1 Innovation This approach can lead to unique and innovative products or services that stand out in the market. If a company can develop cutting-edge technology or a revolutionary solution, it can create a significant competitive advantage. 5.4.2 Brand Identity Product-driven companies often build strong brand identities around their innovative products. Customers may associate the brand with high-quality, premium offerings. 5.4.3 Early Adoption Some customers are attracted to new and groundbreaking products, making early adopters a target audience. 5.5 Factors for Product-Driven Differentiation: 5.5.1 Research and Development Invest in robust R&amp;D capabilities to drive innovation. 5.5.2 Market Timing Launching new products at the right time can be crucial for success. 5.5.3 Marketing and Promotion Effective marketing strategies are needed to educate customers about the unique features and benefits of the product. 5.6 Customer-Driven Approach for Differentiation: 5.6.1 Tailored Solutions Understanding customer needs allows a company to develop tailored solutions that directly address pain points. This can lead to products or services that precisely fit what the market desires. 5.6.2 Customer Loyalty Providing solutions that align with customer needs can foster strong customer loyalty and repeat business. 5.6.3 Word of Mouth Satisfied customers are more likely to become advocates and recommend the company’s offerings to others. 5.7 Factors for Customer-Driven Differentiation: 5.7.1 Market Research Conduct thorough market research to uncover customer preferences and pain points. 5.7.2 Customer Feedback Actively gather and listen to customer feedback to adapt and improve offerings. 5.7.3 Agility Be prepared to pivot quickly to meet changing customer demands. 5.8 Factors to Consider for Choosing the Right Approach: 5.8.1 Market Dynamics Consider the maturity of the market and the competitive landscape. In rapidly changing markets, a product-driven approach may be necessary for disruption, while established markets may benefit more from a customer-driven approach. 5.8.2 Resources Evaluate your company’s resources, capabilities, and expertise. A product-driven approach may require significant R&amp;D investments. 5.8.3 Customer-Centricity Assess how well you can align with customer needs and whether your target market values tailored solutions. 5.8.4 Risk Tolerance Consider the level of risk your company is willing to take. Customer-driven strategies are generally considered less risky because they are based on validated market needs. 5.9 Hybrid Strategies Many successful companies use a combination of both approaches to differentiate and innovate while still meeting customer needs. Ultimately, differentiation in the marketplace requires a deep understanding of the target audience, whether it’s achieved through innovative products or tailored solutions. The key is to continually adapt to changing market dynamics and customer preferences to maintain a competitive edge. 5.10 The amount of available funding and the business experience of the owner can significantly affect the choice of strategy for a startup or an existing business. Here’s how: 5.11 Funding Availability High Funding If a business has substantial funding or access to significant capital, it may have the resources to pursue a product-driven approach. This means investing in research and development to create innovative products or services that can disrupt the market. High funding allows for the development of cutting-edge technologies and the ability to take risks in pursuit of differentiation. Limited Funding Startups or businesses with limited funding may opt for a customer-driven approach. With constrained resources, it’s often more practical to identify existing market needs and develop solutions that directly address those needs. This approach minimizes the risk of investing heavily in unproven product concepts. 5.12 Business Experience Experienced Entrepreneurs Entrepreneurs with extensive business experience may have a deeper understanding of market dynamics, customer behavior, and industry trends. They are more likely to use their experience to inform their strategy. Experienced entrepreneurs may be better equipped to assess the feasibility of product-driven approaches and manage the associated risks. Novice Entrepreneurs Novice entrepreneurs, especially those entering a new industry or market, may prioritize a customer-driven approach. Their lack of industry experience may lead them to rely on market research and customer feedback to guide their decisions. This approach can help mitigate the risks associated with inexperience. It’s important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the choice between a product-driven or customer-driven strategy depends on various factors, including market conditions, competitive landscape, available resources, and the entrepreneur’s goals. In some cases, a hybrid strategy that combines elements of both approaches may be the most effective way to balance innovation with market demand. Additionally, businesses should be adaptable and willing to reassess their strategy as circumstances change, including shifts in funding availability or the accumulation of business experience. Entering New Markets: Expanding into new markets, whether they are geographic regions or online platforms, often requires courage. It’s a leap into the unknown, and there are risks involved. It takes courage to venture into unfamiliar territory and face potential challenges. Competing with Established Players: If you’re entering a marketplace with dominant competitors, it takes confidence to challenge them. You’ll need to believe in your unique value proposition and the courage to stand up to established players. Innovation: Marketplace success comes from being unique in a dimension that is important to customers. Whether it’s offering a unique product, service, pricing model or experience. A certain resolve is required to go against the grain and introduce something new. You must be steadfast when you encounter the inevitable resistance when you don’t follow traditional industry norms. Courage will help you persevere. Dealing with Uncertainty: Marketplaces are dynamic, and conditions can change rapidly. Having the courage to adapt and pivot your strategy when necessary is crucial. This means making tough decisions and sometimes letting go of strategies or products that aren’t working. Ethical Considerations: Courage is vital when it comes to ethical decision-making in the marketplace.

This type of courage is essential for owners who aim to create a competitive advantage and capture the attention of their target audience. [Describe any Unique products? Unique services? Unique customer experiences?] Here are some key aspects of business courage in the context of differentiation: Challenging the Status Quo: Courageous owners are not content with following industry norms or copying competitors. They question existing practices and explore innovative ways to do things differently. They recognize that true differentiation often requires challenging conventional wisdom. [Describe some things you do that are ‘status quo’ for your industry? Are you copying competitors? Are you following industry norms? Do you question your existing practices? Do you look for innovative ways to make your customers happier? Describe the last time you challenged conventional wisdom.] Innovation: Being different begins with innovation in product, processes, or both. You need the courage to invest in research and development, experiment with new technologies and processes, and pioneer creative solutions. This will involve taking some risks and deviating from the tried-and-true. [Describe any recent innovations in product, processes, or marketing. Is your R&amp;D budget increasing? Describe recent creative customer solutions you’ve pioneered.] Risk-Taking: Courageous differentiation involves calculated risk-taking. Business leaders must assess potential risks and rewards and be willing to move forward even when outcomes are uncertain. They understand that playing it safe will lead to stagnation and missed opportunities. [Describe a recent situation where you ‘played it safe’ and missed an opportunity. Describe a recent situation where you ‘took a chance’ when the outcome was uncertain.] Long-Term Vision: Differentiation isn’t just about immediate gains; it requires a long-term perspective. Courageous owners are committed to their unique value propositions and are willing to invest time and resources in building a sustainable competitive advantage. [Do you have a competitive advantage? Describe recent investments of time and resources building that advantage.] Resilience: Not all attempts at differentiation will be successful, and setbacks are inevitable. Business courage means having the resilience to persevere in the face of challenges. It involves learning from failures and adapting strategies accordingly. [Describe a recent situation where you perservered in the face of challenges. Describe a recent ‘failure’ and how you adapted your strategy accordingly.] Customer-Centric: It takes more courage than you think to develop a deep understanding of customer needs and preferences. Owners must have the courage to listen to customer feedback, adapt to changing demands, and align their operations with what customers value. [Describe a recent example of when you listened to customer feedback and changed your company to address those changing demands.] Marketing and Communication: Effectively communicating how and why you are different to the market requires courage and creativity. Courageous owners develop compelling messaging and branding that highlight their uniqueness. They are not afraid to be bold in their marketing efforts. [Describe a recent marketing effort that you consider ‘bold’.] Leadership: courage always starts at the top. Business leaders must lead by example, fostering a culture of innovation, risk-taking, and differentiation within their organizations. They should encourage employees to share innovative ideas without fear of criticism. [Describe a recent example of leading by example. Describe a recent example of encouraging employees to innovate and take risks. Can your employees share innovative ideas without fear?] Adaptability: Markets evolve, and customer preferences change. Courageous owners are adaptable and open to revisiting their differentiation strategies as needed. They understand that what sets them apart today may not do so in the future. [Describe how you keep your differentiation strategy ‘fresh’.] Competitive Edge: Ultimately, differentiation through courage provides a competitive edge. It allows companies to capture market share, build brand loyalty, and thrive in competitive environments. [Describe how you are thriving now in your competitive environment.] In summary, business courage in the context of differentiation is about having the audacity to be different, the vision to see the potential rewards, and the resilience to overcome obstacles. It’s a strategic mindset that sets successful companies apart and allows them to create lasting value in the marketplace.
