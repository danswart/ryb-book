Market tactics are the methods we use to execute our Competitive Strategy.  Typical tactics include...

- Quality levels
- Pricing decisions
- Cost structures
- Service levels
- Consumer sentiment
- Production constraints
- Customer emotions
<br><br>


All of these factors, and many more, are potential points you can use to outperform your competitors and give you a competitive advantage.  You can achieve a strong competitive advantage with a unique or creative combination of several factors.  Sometimes an innovation in any one of them can completely disrupt the market.

One thing we know for sure is conventional thinking in this area will not bring you what you need or want.

Before we start manipulating the various tactics willy nilly, we must be clear on how we intend to create value. need to establish several other strategies.

Dr. W. Edward Deming cautioned repeatedly not to establish goals without including a method to achieve the goal.  Market Tactics answers the all-important question: "By what method?"

<span style="color: red;">Example:</span> Walmart provides goods at lower prices than its competitors.

<span style="color: blueviolet;">By what method?</span>  Efficient supply chain management and large-scale operations.


To-Do-That diagrams are perfect for answering the 'by what method?' question.





## 'How-To' Gain and Hold the Advantage

Marketing tactics play a critical role in strategic management, acting as the concrete actions or 'how-to' steps necessary to realize the overarching strategy of a company.  While strategy outlines the long-term direction and objectives of the business, tactics are about the here and now - the specific methods and actions taken to achieve these strategic goals.  They are the operational elements that bring a marketing strategy to life, translating high-level plans into operational tasks.

Tactics are inherently detail-oriented and short-term in nature, focusing on immediate or near-term actions that contribute to larger strategic objectives. For example, if a company's strategy is to become the market leader in a specific sector, its tactics might include aggressive marketing campaigns, competitive pricing strategies, or partnerships with key players in the industry. These tactical moves are designed to build market share, enhance brand recognition, and create customer loyalty - all of which serve the broader strategic goal of market leadership.

One of the main characteristics of effective marketing tactics is their flexibility and adaptability. Unlike strategy, which is more stable and long-term, tactics can and should be adjusted frequently based on market feedback and changing conditions. This agility allows businesses to respond quickly to new opportunities, competitive threats, or shifts in consumer preferences. For instance, in response to a competitor's product launch, a company might tactically ramp up promotional activities or introduce product enhancements to maintain its competitive edge.

Effective tactical execution requires close review to assess the effectiveness in realizing the company's strategy.  The system of delivering customer value implements the tactics and management helps to ensure that all actions contribute cohesively towards the same end goal. This alignment is critical because misaligned tactics can lead to wasted resources, market confusion, and missed opportunities. 

It involves continuous communication and coordination across various departments within the organization, ensuring that everyone is allowed to and does work towards the same strategic objectives and that tactical decisions are made within the context of the larger strategic plan.

In sum, marketing tactics are the tools and techniques used to execute a marketing strategy successfully. They represent the practical steps taken every day to move the company closer to its strategic goals. 

While strategy provides the direction and sets the destination, tactics are about the journey - the specific routes, maneuvers, and adjustments made along the way to reach that destination. 

The art of business management lies not only in crafting a compelling strategy but also in deploying the right tactics to bring that strategy to fruition, ensuring that the business navigates successfully through the complex and ever-changing market landscape.
