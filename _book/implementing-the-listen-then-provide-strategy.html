<p>Many successful companies use a combination of both approaches to differentiate and innovate while still meeting customer needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, differentiation in the marketplace requires a deep understanding of the target audience, whether it’s achieved through innovative products or tailored solutions. The key is to continually adapt to changing market dynamics and customer preferences to maintain a competitive edge.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">18.10</span> The amount of available funding and the business experience of the owner can significantly affect the choice of strategy for a startup or an existing business. Here’s how:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-amount-of-available-funding-and-the-business-experience-of-the-owner-can-significantly-affect-the-choice-of-strategy-for-a-startup-or-an-existing-business.-heres-how"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>High Funding</li>
</ul>
<p>If a business has substantial funding or access to significant capital, it may have the resources to pursue a product-driven approach. This means investing in research and development to create innovative products or services that can disrupt the market. High funding allows for the development of cutting-edge technologies and the ability to take risks in pursuit of differentiation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited Funding</li>
</ul>
<p>Startups or businesses with limited funding may opt for a customer-driven approach. With constrained resources, it’s often more practical to identify existing market needs and develop solutions that directly address those needs. This approach minimizes the risk of investing heavily in unproven product concepts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">18.12</span> Business Experience<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#business-experience"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Experienced Entrepreneurs</li>
</ul>
<p>Entrepreneurs with extensive business experience may have a deeper understanding of market dynamics, customer behavior, and industry trends. They are more likely to use their experience to inform their strategy. Experienced entrepreneurs may be better equipped to assess the feasibility of product-driven approaches and manage the associated risks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Novice Entrepreneurs</li>
</ul>
<p>Novice entrepreneurs, especially those entering a new industry or market, may prioritize a customer-driven approach. Their lack of industry experience may lead them to rely on market research and customer feedback to guide their decisions. This approach can help mitigate the risks associated with inexperience.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the choice between a product-driven or customer-driven strategy depends on various factors, including market conditions, competitive landscape, available resources, and the entrepreneur’s goals.</p>
<p>In some cases, a hybrid strategy that combines elements of both approaches may be the most effective way to balance innovation with market demand. Additionally, businesses should be adaptable and willing to reassess their strategy as circumstances change, including shifts in funding availability or the accumulation of business experience.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Entering New Markets: Expanding into new markets, whether they are geographic regions or online platforms, often requires courage. It’s a leap into the unknown, and there are risks involved. It takes courage to venture into unfamiliar territory and face potential challenges.</p></li>
<li><p>Competing with Established Players: If you’re entering a marketplace with dominant competitors, it takes confidence to challenge them. You’ll need to believe in your unique value proposition and the courage to stand up to established players.</p></li>
<li><p>Innovation: Marketplace success comes from being unique in a dimension that is important to customers. Whether it’s offering a unique product, service, pricing model or experience. A certain resolve is required to go against the grain and introduce something new. You must be steadfast when you encounter the inevitable resistance when you don’t follow traditional industry norms. Courage will help you persevere.</p></li>
<li><p>Dealing with Uncertainty: Marketplaces are dynamic, and conditions can change rapidly. Having the courage to adapt and pivot your strategy when necessary is crucial. This means making tough decisions and sometimes letting go of strategies or products that aren’t working.</p></li>

Net Profit, after expenses (to be used for next year’s working capital) FIXED costs for ‘Labor’ (as a percentage of gross sales), and FIXED costs for all ‘Other Expenses’ (as a percentage of gross sales) 27 Let’s make some estimates and compute the Desired Minimum Sales for our example company: Estimate Needed Amount Desired Salary $ ??? Annual Retirement Contribution $ ??? Annual Health Insurance $ ??? Fixed Labor Cost ?? % Fixed Other Costs ?? % Residual Profit $ ??? 28 Your NET salary must be large enough to cover: food utilities shelter 29 living in a safe
neighborhood some financial security healthcare safety 30 And, these eventual costs must be covered as well: Education for loved ones Charitable giving (if you’re so inclined) 31 Just add these items up…
and that’s your NET desired salary! 32 Assume you want your GROSS salary to be $150,000 annually Estimate Needed Amount Desired Salary $150,000 33 Next, the business must cover your annual retirement plan contribution. 34 This depends entirely on WHEN you begin your retirement savings. 35 This depends entirely on WHEN you begin your retirement savings.

Soooo, the lesson is: 45 The graph is NOT a straight line; it swoops upward more and more as you approach age 50. Soooo, the lesson is: Your company must grow large enough, and fast enough, or you will not be able to retire at any age! 45 Think it’s Impossible to Begin at 40? 46 Warren Buffet describes starting a business at the age of 40! The Inspirational Story of Enterprise Rent A Car Warren Buffet 47 Let’s say your retirement plan contribution requirement turns out to be $15,000 annually Estimate Needed Amount Desired Salary $150,000 Annual Retirement Contribution $15,000 48 After salary and retirement, you must estimate your annual family healthcare premiums 49 After salary and retirement, you must estimate your annual family healthcare premiums
(You’re probably already paying premiums, so that’s an easy one to estimate) 49 Let’s say premiums of $18,000 annually for a family of 3 Estimate Needed Amount Desired Salary $150,000 Annual Retirement Contribution $15,000 Annual Health Insurance $18,000 50 Next, estimate…
your desired net profit (after expenses).
(this is to be used for next year’s working capital) 51 For demonstration purposes let’s say that $50,000 profit will allow you to safely operate in the new year. Estimate Needed Amount Desired Salary $150,000 Annual Retirement Contribution $15,000 Annual Health Insurance $18,000 Residual Profit $50,000 52 Finally, you must estimate:
FIXED business expenses (as percentages of gross revenue) (fixed expenses don’t go up or
down based on the amount of
sales you have - they’re ‘fixed’) 53 HERE IS A “NORMALIZED” PROFIT &amp; LOSS STATEMENT Amount Pct Sales $500,000 100% Cost of Goods Sold ($175,000) (35%) Gross Profit $325,000 65% ‘Fixed’ Labor Cost ($100,000) (20%) ‘Fixed’ Other Costs ($175,000) (35%) Net Profit $50,000 10% 54 Calculating A Desired Salary 55 56 For a personal service company those percentages are usually around 33% for ‘Fixed Labor…’ and 33% for ‘Fixed Other Expenses’ 57 Let’s recap… Estimate Needed Amount Desired Salary $150,000 Annual Retirement Contribution $15,000 Annual Health Insurance $18,000 Fixed Labor Cost 33% Fixed Other Costs 33% Residual Profit $50,000 58 In today’s example, how much would you guess the Desired Minimum Sales needs to be? 59 In today’s example, how much would you guess the Desired Minimum Sales needs to be?
