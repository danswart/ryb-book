My Mission is to
 Create Happy
  Customers
  How About You?

THE CHALLENGE WE
FACE...


 How to become Unique in
     the marketplace
Because the more Unique you are, the
  more successfull you can become


In the Marketplace
Contrast is Power


The best way to contrast with your
competitors
   is to be very Effective AND very

    from your customer's point of view


Unique
means
Standing out from
the crowd



Unique
means
being
unconventional



Avoid conventional logic because all
your competitors will use that

   Test counter-intuitive ideas because
                your competitors won't



What is the Best Way to
 'Stand Out' and Be
       Unique?

Create the unstoppable chain
reaction:
     Become very Effective, then
Build awesome Capability to deliver
 And you will be irresistably Unique


So, what does it mean
  to be "effective?"


Effective
means knowing what
creates REAL value for
customers - in their terms

and having the capability
to deliver it upon demand



   Effective means...
Strictly from the customer's point
             of view




Your efforts must be Useful, or
          Fulfill a desire, or
                       Solve a problem
From the customer's point of view



Effective
does NOT mean

Expedient

Expedient =
          Quick, Interim or Temporary
Short-term, often at the expense of the
               long-term

Putting out fires, often at the expense
of the customer

   Strangely, the opposite is NOT true:


   Efficient ≠ Effective
As you become more Effective you will
 automatically become more efficient

 Productive ≠ Effective
As you become more Effective you will
automatically become more productive


 But, don't just take my word for it...


Let's hear what Warren Buffet thinks
  about Effectiveness in delighting
             customers



Buffet on the Importance of 'Customer Delight





Some Cold, Hard Facts...




Half of new businesses fail in 5 years.
By year 10 fully two-thirds are gone.
    Only 10% make it to 20 years.





    Studies and surveys also show
shocking failure rates for improvement
    initiatives that can range from

    50% to 70% or even higher.



If you are ambitious and flexible,
  this is all good news for you!
* If you become Effective enough,
* If you become Capable enough,


* You will become Unique enough.

It’s not remarkable that companies fail.

 It’s remarkable that
they fail so often, and
   have for so long!

Obviously, we make the same mistakes
         over and over again


Otherwise, those grim survival statistics
    would have improved long ago,
                RIGHT?

And what about
the companies
that are just
surviving?
They are neither
fully alive nor
completely dead

This is not a laziness problem, or an
        intelligence problem.
Most business owners are very hard-
working, and good at what they do.
               Right?


But they’re not very good at turning all
            that hard work
    into prosperity and a better life
               are they?


Where Companies Go
      Wrong


What?!




They are ‘Same-As’:
EACH COMPANY
JUST LIKE THE
REST
 Afraid to be different


'Same-As' companies don't last long in
           the marketplace





They Copy, Copy, Copy
Everyone from business
schools to self-help books
continue to tell owners that
copying others is the
solution to their problems.




'Follow-the-Herd' companies don't
stand a chance in the marketplace





Woo Hoo! Let's do
what everyone else
      does!


On top of that, most 'Solutions' are
 Incompatible with their existing
             systems





  For example, companies naturally
adopt the style of management known
      as ‘command-and-control’





Unfortunately
most improvement
schemes (and many
company goals) are
incompatible with this style
of management




So, most improvement efforts are
    doomed from the outset





So, what's a leader to do?
* Learn to be more Effective,

                                in the eyes of your customers

* Learn to be more Capable

                                in the eyes of your customers

* Learn to be more Unique

                                in the eyes of your customers 51

These things hardly cost a thing...
* But, they require a different mindset
* A sense of urgency, and
* The willingness to try new things



  The reward is to
become Unique in the
    marketplace

Which is the Point!


WHAT TO DO NOW?


FIRST...
Adopt a plain-spoken aim such as "Our
Mission is to Create Happy Customers!"
Lose the corporate-speak, gobbelty-gook
jargon. It makes it much harder for
everyone to do a great job.

Next...    Learn
first-hand what your
customers value --

 from their point of view





Next...   Learn
first-hand, what your
customers experience
when dealing with your
company

(the good, bad, and ugly)


Remember, management Is Not Very
Good at Guessing What Customers Value


  So, it PAYS (a lot) to
   Ask Them Directly

         Case Study
Initially, Dr. T and her team came up
with 23 ideas of creating more value
            for her customers



Let's see how they did
   by themselves...


If there is any way at
           all
   Ask Customers
      Directly!

 It PAYS (a lot) to
Ask Them Directly

Then...
create Capability so
customers can pull the
value they need from you

(when, where, and how
they want to)



        Case Study
Stew Leonard's Dairy has mastered
the ability to 'Listen, then Deliver'


Stew Jr on the Power of Customer Suggestions





Some Things To AVOID...


BEWARE OF...
Slogans, and so-called ‘best practices’,
Agile, Lean, or Six-Sigma,
Mission & Vision statements full of buzzwords,
Servant leadership

              These are management fads

  They all avoid the responsibiltiy to

create and maintain a system based on

     Effectiveness and Capability
