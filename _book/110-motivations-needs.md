## Awareness -- Motivations


That's right; I'm going to question your motivations!  Postpone your indignation for just a few moments to give us enough time to clarify your WHY.  It will release the power of belief into your efforts.

It is certainly your right to open a company.  But, why do YOU need to have a company?  With your skill set, degree, or certification you could earn decent money as an employee without all the headaches.  What are your motivations?

Are you just looking for a way to avoid having a boss?

Why should it be YOU that brings this new product or service to the marketplace?


Seriously.


Your reasons are your own, but somewhere along the line you must believe that you are the right person (maybe the ONLY person) to bring this project into the world.  Are you convinced that your way of doing things can make a difference for others?


## Ideas to Actions

**EXERCISE 1-1**

<span style="color: red;">**Interactive Online Version:**</span>  [https://danswart.shinyapps.io/ryb-exercises-1-1/]

Ideas take form when you commit them to writing.  Write your answers to the following:


1. **List your personal motivations.  They don't have to be politically correct, socially conscious, or profound...just honest.**
<br>
<br>

1. **Draft a brief statement of why YOU are the right (or only) person to bring this project to the world.**

## Awareness of Marketplace Needs

You're still reading, so apparently after some soul-searching you've concluded that you're the best person (maybe the ONLY person) to do the job.  But, does anyone in the marketplace share your vision of what is needed?

Does your local (regional, national, or global) market *really* need another...<br>

- Doctor's office

- Big-box store

- Architect firm

- CPA firm

- Grocery store

- Funeral home

- Auto parts store

- Fast-food restaurant

- Beauty salon

- Printer

- Auto repair shop

- Bookkeeper

- Graphic design firm

- Marketing firm....?


Kent Billingsley (author of the excellent book  _Entrepreneur to Millionaire_ (available here) asks you put your great idea off to the side for a moment and examine the marketplace.  Can you identify an unmet need in the marketplace?  If so, then specify how your new idea will address it.  Even if you don't personally have the skill, expertise or technical know-how that is needed you can always hire or partner with others who do.

Most people approach it the opposite way.  They acquire a skill, a degree or certification and get an idea.  They jump in and hope the marketplace will reward them for working so hard in the past and taking the leap to open a company. These are often the companies that struggle the most. 

Mr. Billingsley devised a powerful set of 3 questions to clarify **why your company even exists.**<br>

- **"What marketplace problem are you offering to solve?"**

- **"Why hasn't this problem been solved yet?"** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and

- **"What is your UNIQUE solution?"**

He points out that the **FIRST** question is strictly from the consumer's point of view. Your proposed solution should not be anywhere in your answer to this question.

The **SECOND** question is strictly a statement of **WHY** a satisfactory solution is still not available - strictly from the customer's point of view.  Again, your proposed solution should not appear anywhere in this answer.

Finally, the **THIRD** question is about **YOU** and **YOUR solution**, but you must also describe how your solution is **UNIQUE**.

You might be shocked to learn that many established companies struggle to answer these three questions. They may be surviving and might even be doing well right now, but only because their competitors are likewise unable to supply the answers.


Example:

- **"What marketplace problem are you offering to solve?"**

    High-end home builders in the area can't find reliable framing contractors with high construction standards and professional project management skills.  Contractors are routinely late on delivery and overbudget.  These factors, combined with rising interest rates and material costs, seriously erode profitablilty for home builders.


- **"Why hasn't this problem been solved yet?"**

     Contract work is traditionally awarded on the basis of price alone.  Contractors chronically underbid jobs then cannot deliver without cutting corners.  They deliver poor quality, hop from job to job, and are financially fragile.  Rework from poor quality eviscerates their margins.  Paying crews under the table for poor quality creates further instability.


- **"What is your UNIQUE solution?"**

    Providing high quality construction methods, materials, and workmanship with superior project management skills at competitive prices will increase profits for builders and contractors alike.  WIN-WIN.

<br>

The 'three-questions' method provides a stringent test of your intuition and how much market research you do before opening your business.  When large sums of capital are at risk, direct measurements of how consumer's will react to the product or service are often collected.  Even then, no amount of 'research' can guarantee success.

Companies with insufficient effort on this step may have to act on supposition, superstition, or faith. They usually find themselves using a Product-Driven Strategy (<span class="f4 darkgreen">'Make, then Sell'</span>) whether it's best or not. 

On the other hand, astonishingly, in 1975 advertising executive Gary Dahl sold over 1 million 'Pet Rocks' for $4 each and became a millionaire!  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock)

(more on your value strategy choices in Chapter ??)


## Considerations When Answering the 3 Questions

- Competitive Landscape

Assess the competition in your industry or niche. Are there gaps in the market that you can fill with innovative products, or is it saturated with similar offerings? Understanding the competitive landscape will guide your choice of strategy later.

- Market Research

Conduct market research to identify market trends, perceived customer preferences, and unmet needs.  You need not hire expensive marketing firms to do this.  Small business owners usually have a responsive customer base that can provide targeted feedback to help gather this information.

- Speed to Market

Consider how quickly you need to bring your product or service to market.  If there's a time-sensitive opportunity, a product-driven approach may be required. 

- Risk Tolerance

Honestly assess your risk tolerance as a business owner. Product-driven approaches often involve higher risks because they require substantial investments in product development before the need is known. A <span class="royalblue">'Listen, then Provide'</span> approach may offer a safer entry into the market.

- Business Expertise

Evaluate your expertise and that of your team. Do you have industry-specific knowledge or technical skills that the competition will find difficult to duplicate?  Or, will enable you to create innovative products?

- Long-Term Vision

Consider your long-term vision for the business. Are you looking for sustainable growth and customer loyalty, or is your goal to create disruptive innovations that could lead to rapid expansion? Your vision will also guide your choice of strategy later.
